# Feature-Engineering-NLP
Link to my kaggle notebook: (please find my project here, to observe the profiling report and interactive visualizations) : https://www.kaggle.com/breenda/feature-engineering/data <br> 
Textual Data comes in plenty but is unorganised and messy in its raw form. Hence, feature engineering is an important step before training a machine to make predictions based on the given data.<br>
In my notebook, I have explored a number of preprocessing and feature engineering techniques to gain insights from a collection of fake and real news data. <br>
